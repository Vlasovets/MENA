# Introduction

The study of the human microbiome and its impact on health and disease has gained significant attention in recent years. One of the key tools for investigating the microbial communities associated with different environments is 16S rRNA sequencing, which provides information about the taxonomic composition of the community. However, processing and analyzing large amounts of 16S rRNA data can be a complex and time-consuming task.

To address this challenge, we present a data processing pipeline for 16S rRNA microbiome data using the QIIME2 platform. QIIME2 is a powerful and widely used platform for the analysis of microbial community data, providing a range of tools for data pre-processing, quality control, and downstream analysis. In this work, we describe the steps involved in creating a QIIME2-based pipeline for the processing of 16S rRNA data, including data quality control, denoising, clustering, and taxonomic classification.

Our pipeline provides a streamlined and reproducible approach for the processing and analysis of 16S rRNA microbiome data, enabling researchers to efficiently and accurately study the microbial communities associated with different environments. This pipeline is intended to serve as a starting point for further analysis and to facilitate the integration of new data into existing studies.

# Results

In this study, we have collected 16S rRNA data from [@al2022gut] and subjected it to a comprehensive data processing pipeline. The data has been previously demultiplexed into individual samples. We followed by a denoising step to remove any errors using DADA2 [@callahan2016dada2]. A Naive Bayes classifier was then trained using the Silva database to accurately classify the taxonomy of the microbial communities [@robeson2021rescript].

Our pipeline is designed to provide a streamlined and reproducible approach to processing 16S rRNA microbiome data, enabling researchers to efficiently and accurately study the microbial communities associated with different environments. The pipeline is open-source, allowing other researchers to adapt and modify it to suit their specific needs.

In conclusion, this pipeline provides a powerful tool for the processing and analysis of 16S rRNA microbiome data, enabling researchers to gain new insights into the microbial communities associated with different environments. The open-source nature of the pipeline also enables others to easily build upon and expand upon our work.

# Discussion and/or Conclusion

Microbiome research is still in its infancy in the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) region and is underrepresented in comparison to other regions. One of the major challenges in this field is the limited amount of data available, which has hindered the development of comprehensive and representative models of the microbial communities in this region.

However, despite the limited availability of data, we were able to find one dataset [@al2022gut] that can be used as a reference model for future work. This dataset provides valuable information about the taxonomic composition of the microbial communities in the region and can serve as a baseline for comparison with other datasets in the future.

It is important to note that this reference model is not meant to be representative of the entire MENA region, as the limited amount of data available may not reflect the diversity of microbial communities in different ecological and geographical settings. However, it provides a starting point for further studies and highlights the need for increased investment in microbiome research in the MENA region.

In conclusion, while the limited availability of data remains a challenge in microbiome research in the MENA region, our findings demonstrate that it is possible to develop reference models that can be used for future studies. Future investment in this field is needed to expand our understanding of the microbial communities in this region.

# Future work

In future work, we plan to expand the scope of our test pipeline to other Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) regions. This will help us to determine the generalizability of our pipeline to a wider range of datasets and to validate the robustness of our approach in different ecological and geographical settings.

Additionally, we plan to integrate taxonomic information with phenotype information. This will be achieved by leveraging resources such as BacDive, which provides a wealth of information about the phenotype, lifestyle, and ecology of bacterial species. Integrating this information with our pipeline will allow us to better understand the relationship between the taxonomy and phenotypic traits of the bacteria in our datasets.

This combination of taxonomic and phenotype information will also provide valuable insights into the functional diversity of the bacterial communities in different MENA regions and will help us to identify potential key players in various environmental processes. Ultimately, this will help us to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the microbial diversity in the MENA region and to identify new targets for biotechnology and bioremediation applications.
